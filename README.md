Mother Macro

Our goal is to help users save as much money as possible on their health insurance, especially during these times. That's why we've created Mother Macro. By encouraging users to eat a healthier and more rounded diet, we're partnering with health insurance agencies to get users even better deals 
## TO DO: 
- [ ] Add in user's insurance information to MongoDB
- [ ] Logging food functionality 
- [ ] Add in user recognition for users to snap pictures of made suggested meal plan to gain 'points' towards saving money on health insurance 
- [ ] Add in activity tracker for users to also log exercise and activity in order to also gain points towards saving money, possibly hrough linking Strava activity via their apis
- [ ] Optional: Google API access/implementation
- [ ] Optional: Implement some kind of reward system for users that level up: animated profiles, something aside from increased savings
